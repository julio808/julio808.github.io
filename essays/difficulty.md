The reason I decided to major in MIS is because I wanted to start a career in Information Technology. I began by joining the National Guard in highschool and became proficient in the area of communications and transmissions. I have also learned about satellite communications and other systems. I believe this major will provide essential skills to my career as I am transitioning into networking and security. I am currently studying to obtain Comptia certifications to further grow in this field.
